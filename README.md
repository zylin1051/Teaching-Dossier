## About Me

I am a Master of Mathematics candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada🇨🇦.
My research focuses on causal inference, particularly imputation-based methods for missing-by-design data within the potential outcomes framework. This background informs my teaching of applied statistics, especially in areas related to estimation, inference, and real-world data challenges.
